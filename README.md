# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Louise is an up-and-coming playwright looking to crowdfund her new play *Fever* using the crowdsourcing platform Kickstarter. She anticipates the play will require a production budget of over $10,000. Louise asked for help to determine whether there are specific factors which allowed similar project campaigns to meet their fundraising goals so that she may utilize the same techniques for *Fever*.

Kickstarter campaigns data for theater productions and plays launched between 2010 and 2017 was analyzed using Microsoft Excel. Data for successful, failed, and cancelled theater fundraising campaigns was reviewed by campaign launch month. Additionally, the percentage of successful, failed, and canceled campaigns was analyzed in accordance with the campaign fundraising goals. 

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to help Louise understand historical Kickstarter data to develop a strategy to increase her chances of launching a successful fundraising campaign for *Fever*. 

## Analysis and Challenges
We obtained theater fundraising data from 19 countries available between 2010 to 2017 (1,393 records). Of the theater records, we further drilled down to Kickstarter campaigns specific to plays (1,066 records). Theater records were analyzed based on the month in which their crowdfunding campaigns were launched. Play records were analyzed based on the amount of their fundraising goals. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Of the 1,369 crowdsourcing theater campaigns launched on Kickstarter between 2010 and 2017, 839 successfully met their fundraising goals, 493 failed, and 37 campaigns were cancelled. In general, there were more successful campaigns every month than there failed campaigns during this timeframe. Relatively few campaigns were canceled during any month. The relative number of successful and failed theater crowdsourcing campaigns appears to mirror one another – generally, the months where there are greater numbers of successful campaigns, there are also greater numbers of failed campaigns. The number of canceled campaigns is low every month. 

The most successful theater campaigns were launched in May. Relatively high numbers of successful campaigns were also launched in February, April, June, July, and August. The month with the least successful campaigns launched is December. Please reference the Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date graphic below for further details.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Next, the percentage of successful, failed, and cancelled campaigns was based on fundraising goals. Campaigns were analyzed in $5,000 increments beginning with campaign goals <$1,000 and ending with campaign goals exceeding $50,000.  

The percentage of successful campaigns was greater than unsuccessful for play campaigns with goals between >$1,000 and $15,000. There were also more successful campaigns with funding goals between $35,000 and $45,000. Kickstarter campaigns for plays with goals between $20,000 and $35,000 as well as campaigns with goals exceeding $45,000 were more likely to fail their stated goals. Please reference the Outcomes Based on Goal graphic below for further details.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
While an analysis of this data has provided some helpful insights, Kickstarter’s data also includes significant data gaps. Detailed below are four noteworthy data gaps. 
-	It is unclear where Louise intends to crowdfund and produce her play. The success of theater and plays Kickstarter campaigns may vary greatly depending on local demographics (i.e., population, income, quantity of cultural institutions, political environment, etc.). 
-	Second, this data is outdated. Some of the data is over ten years old. Crowdfunding patterns may have changed in this period of timeframe. 
-	This dataset does not include much information. Qualitative data such as play genre, reception, marketing copy and other techniques used are not included. These and other factors undoubtedly had an impact on the success of a fundraising goals. 
-	Lastly, this data was collected prior to the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. At present, many theater productions have been cancelled altogether or are running at limited capacity. Even with the best data-based strategies, it may not be possible to successfully fundraise for any theater production during a global pandemic.  

## Results
#### What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
My analysis indicated that the greatest number of successful Kickstarter campaigns were launched in May while the least number of successful campaigns were launched in December. Based on this information, I recommend that Louise launch her campaign in May, and I would advise her against launching a campaign in December. 

#### What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Louise previously stated that she anticipates needing over $10,000 to producer her play, *Fever*. The data appears to indicate that she will have a 

#### What are some limitations of this dataset?
As described above, this dataset has several limitations. Of these limitations, below are four notable data gaps in the Kickstarter dataset.
-	Location data is not adequately refined;
-	Data is outdated;
-	Available data is limited and does not include relevant qualitative data; and
-	Data was collected prior to the Covid-19 pandemic.

#### What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
An analysis of Kickstarter data through present day would be helpful.
